              Kerala saw a major increase in daily Covid-19 deaths being
            reported in the last week. For days now, the state has been
              topping the list of nationwide Covid-related deaths. The reason
              behind this is the reconciliation process which, according to
              experts and the government, is still underway in the state. Deaths
              that were earlier omitted due to various reasons are now being
              added to the Covid death tally. Dr Arun NM, a public health
              activist who has been following the Covid situation in the state,
              said the increase in the death toll is a part of reconciliation.

              number of cases that were once omitted. In the beginning, we were
              only covering around 40 per cent of deaths owing to the elections.
              The reporting of deaths became more accounted for only after June
              16, 2021 during the first Delta peak. The month before that saw
              the highest death toll in the state with around 10,000 deaths," Dr
              Arun said. "Now as the cases are being reconciled, it includes
              cases identified by the government as well as those who come by
              appeal. Before the court order came itself, the government had
              announced that around 7,000 deaths that were omitted due to
              various reasons will be added back. However, even now we cannot
              make an exact estimate since the details of the deaths that are
              being reconciled are not available in public platform. It's still
              murky," he added. High number of Covid deaths reported On Monday,
              71 Covid deaths were reported in Kerala which was the highest in
              the country. On Sunday, 78 deaths were reported while on Saturday,
              the state's daily Covid death count was 241. CHECK THESE OUT MORE

              December 27, the daily Covid death count was 236 while on December
              28 it was 244, 211 deaths on December 29, 164 deaths on December
              30, and 353 deaths on December 31. India has reported 124 Covid
              deaths in the last 24 hours. In this, 71 are from Kerala. Dr KP
              Aravindan, a member of the governmentâ€™s expert panel for Covid
              management, said the reconciliation process is almost reaching the
              end. "Now appeals are considered and are sorted back to back. The
              cases that need to be reconciled have trickled down to smaller
              numbers. Soon, the process will be over. The higher numbers are
              pointing towards the efficient reporting of cases and deaths we
              follow in the state. After Kerala, probably Maharashtra is the
              only state strictly reporting all cases and deaths," he said. Dr
              Padmanabha Shenoy, a public health expert, said the increase in
              death reports is part of the reconciliation process. "It is
              certainly because of the reconciliation underway. It is
              noteworthy, however, that the death percentage is nearing almost 1
              despite the best efforts. We cannot say that Kerala has 'increased
              deaths' because without doubt there is major under counting going
              on in other states," said Dr Shenoy.
